# Netflix UI Clone in Flutter (Progressive Development)

## Overview

This project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive clone of the Netflix mobile application UI using the Flutter framework.  Currently, it focuses on replicating core UI elements and layouts to achieve a familiar user experience.  The repository, located at [https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/netflix-app-ui-design.git](https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/netflix-app-ui-design.git), will be progressively updated with new UI sections, features, and functionalities as development continues. It serves as a dynamic learning opportunity for Flutter UI development, state management, and building complex UIs.

## Technologies Used

* **Flutter:** Cross-platform UI toolkit.
* **Dart:** Flutter's programming language.
* **Flutter ScreenUtil:** For responsive UI design across various screen sizes.
* **GetX:** For robust state management, efficient routing, dependency injection, and other utilities.

## Current Status

This repository is under active development. Expect frequent updates as new parts of the Netflix UI are implemented. Check back regularly to see the progress and explore the evolving codebase.

## Future Development

The goal is to eventually replicate a significant portion of the Netflix mobile UI, including (but not limited to):

* Home Screen with various content carousels
* Movie and TV Show detail pages
* Search functionality
* Navigation elements
* And potentially more features as the project evolves.
